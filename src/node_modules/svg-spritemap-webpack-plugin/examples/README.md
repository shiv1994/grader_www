# Examples
This directory includes basic examples on how you could use the `svg-spritemap-webpack-plugin`. You can run these examples yourself by cloning the repository, navigating to one of the example directories and running the `webpack` command from there.

```shell
$ cd <path-to-repository>/examples/<example>
$ ../../node_modules/.bin/webpack
```

Since a couple of these examples require additional dependencies, make sure to install them:

```shell
$ npm install mini-css-extract-plugin css-loader style-loader sass-loader node-sass less-loader less --no-save
```
